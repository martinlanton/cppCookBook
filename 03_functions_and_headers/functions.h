// Headers are used to declare the functions, variables, classes, etc. that another file might need,
// however, they do not contain any actual code, other files do not need to be aware of the code
// that those functions or classes will run, they only need to be aware of the return and parameter
// types

// Declaring a function in a header is similar to a function definition in a normal file, with the
// difference that it doesn't require the curly brackets containing the code.
